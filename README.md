#Description
This repository contains some simple exercises with arrays data structure implemented with java language. Some files in this repository are:
**1. Craps.java**
Implements the craps game with dices. This file uses a random number generator to generate the dice results and then simulates the process of the game to determine if the players win or lose.
**2. GradeBook.java**
In this file is implemented the process of generating some statistics of the grades of some students, by calculating min, max and average, outputing a graph, etc.
**3. Simpletron.java**
Here is created a simple program that simulates a basic computer with its operations. This is similar to the processor in the real computer where we add, subtract, etc.
